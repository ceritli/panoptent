# Changelog

## 0.9.0 — 2026-10-22

- **English and Turkish UI** across the VS Code panel, page overlay, Chrome extension, popup and notifications, switchable live: `panoptent.language` setting (`auto` follows VS Code's display language), *Panoptent: Change Language* command and **Language** link in the Panoptent view, language select in the preview toolbar, and a **Language** select in the Chrome drawer's Settings tab (Chrome follows VS Code once connected; otherwise its own choice or the browser language)
- Prompts sent to Claude Code are written in the UI language, so Claude replies in it
- Chrome Web Store metadata localized (`_locales/en`, `_locales/tr`)
- Docs: English screenshots and demo shown when the page is in English; English UI labels throughout; lightbox for screenshots and image aspect-ratio fix
- Release workflow also publishes to the VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX (when the tokens are configured)
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-22

First public release under the name **Panoptent** (previously developed as *Panoptes Edit* / *Visual Edit*).

- VS Code preview with click-to-select overlay, inline request box, live style panel, inline text editing, delete, image replace, hierarchy navigation (`Alt` + arrows)
- Change queue with undo/redo and single **Apply**; text edits written directly without AI
- Requests go to the open Claude Code conversation (`@`-mention) or run in the background via Claude Code CLI
- Precise undo: reverses only the edits made for a given apply, using Claude Code's session log
- Mobile/tablet-only changes
- Chrome extension with local bridge (`127.0.0.1`, extension origins only, one-time pairing)
- code-inspector-plugin auto setup (Vite, Next.js webpack/Turbopack, Nuxt)
- Activity bar view, panel docking (left/bottom/right), collapsible side panel
- Chrome: silent port discovery (no `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` noise in the extension error list)
