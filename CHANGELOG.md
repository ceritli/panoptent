# Changelog

## 0.8.0 — 2026-10-22

First public release under the name **Panoptent** (previously developed as *Panoptes Edit* / *Visual Edit*).

- VS Code preview with click-to-select overlay, inline request box, live style panel, inline text editing, delete, image replace, hierarchy navigation (`Alt` + arrows)
- Change queue with undo/redo and single **Apply**; text edits written directly without AI
- Requests go to the open Claude Code conversation (`@`-mention) or run in the background via Claude Code CLI
- Precise undo: reverses only the edits made for a given apply, using Claude Code's session log
- Mobile/tablet-only changes
- Chrome extension with local bridge (`127.0.0.1`, extension origins only, one-time pairing)
- code-inspector-plugin auto setup (Vite, Next.js webpack/Turbopack, Nuxt)
- Activity bar view, panel docking (left/bottom/right), collapsible side panel
- Chrome: silent port discovery (no `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` noise in the extension error list)
